# UFOs - Module 11 

# Overview of Project

    The purpose of this project was to build a table using a given JavaScript array that contains 
  UFO sighting information(date, city, state, country,shape etc). I did so by creating a webite 
  through the use of HTML. To make the table fully dynamic, filters were created to react to 
  user input. The display was customized using Bootstrap. 

# Results 

     The organized UFO data on the webpage will provide convenience to the user looking to gather specific 
  information on UFO sightings. The paragraph image, article title and article are beautifully displayed 
  to grab the user's attention and give a clear idea of the information that will be available to them. 
  See /html_images/webpage_top.png. 
    The filters are set in place for the user's convenience. The fiter's function to help the user to sift 
  through desired parameters: date, city, state, country,shape. See /html_images/webpage_filters.png. 
  For example, the webpage would be  especially useful for people researching UFO sightings in specific 
  regions of the country. The filters are equppied with placeholders that provide the user with an example 
  of possible queries; the rearcher would type 'ca' for a query of the California state. The webpage would
  return information solely of UFO sightings in state of California. Furthermore, the user is able to query
  multiple search parameters at a time. 
  
  # Summary 
  
    One drawback of this design is that the filter search is not responsive to simply clicking "enter" after 
  inputting the query. To sucessfully complete the search the user will have to click tab or click 
  elsewhere. 
    Two recommendations for surther development are: Enabling the search responsiveness to the enter button 
  for convenience and providing a more extensive library of UFO sightings across the world.
